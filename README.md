Project 1: Recipes

This project is the first one I've completed in The Odin Project, but it is not my first website! I learned basic HTML and CSS way back in the day to build websites for my Neopets and code guild layouts. I know I'm not alone in this!!

The goal was to create a simple website with multiple pages and links to get used to the file structure. I also played with text formatting including headers and ordered and unordered lists.

In future lessons, I'll learn CSS to make this prettier.
