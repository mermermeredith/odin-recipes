    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes. In true food blog form, I'll share a personal story before going into the recipe! When my husband and I were first dating long distance, we were both cooking one afternoon. This was a rare occasion because I never cook. Without discussing with each other, we found we were both making esquites! </p>
